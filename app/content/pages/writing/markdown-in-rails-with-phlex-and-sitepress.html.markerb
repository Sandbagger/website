# Markdown in Rails with Phlex and Sitepress
Responding to [Lucian's](https://ruby.social/@lucian/111998966496640844) call to marketing week for Ruby projects, here is a quick write
up on how to use markdown in Rails with Phlex and Sitepress.

## Why?

I've been  wanting to roll my own blog for a while, and I was halfway through combining High Voltage and Frontmatter when I came across
Sitepress which has basically done that for me. 

I am a big fan of what Brad Gessler is doing in the ruby space. In particular, in his appearance on this [podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvCymKMzuhk),
he makes the point about the different phases of a project lifecycle, and the importance of making the gap between inspiration
striking and deploying a landing page as a first step to realizing the vision as short as possible. 

As a secondary goal I have been wanting to take Phlex for a ride so I want to kill two birds with one stone.

## How I did it
Two Sitepress gems:

- sitepress-rails
- markdown-rails

Installation is straightforward following [these instructions](https://sitepress.cc/getting-started/rails). The sharp edge came when trying to integrate 
Phlex (particularly using Phlex layouts) with Sitepress. Brad comment in response to issue [here](https://github.com/sitepress/sitepress/issues/48#issuecomment-1797114086) provided a way forward. 

Installing Phlex was also straightforward. Without much much thought I decided to use Phlex-markdown.
I am not sure of the pros and cons of this as opposed to just using markdown renderer that is bundled with Sitepress.
There is an issue with the current (as of February 2024) version of phlex-markdown but there is a [fix](https://github.com/phlex-ruby/phlex-markdown/issues/6) already in a main branch which I reference in the gemfile. 

Working with Phlex layout component with Sitepress involves ejecting a Sitepress controller.
In this controller, I call a generic phlex-markdown component to render the markdown.

I am not sure whether this is the best way to do this, but it works! 

One thing I would like to do is support the use of erb inside of the markdown, but this is a work in progress.

## Conclusion
I am fairly content with the result and it has formed the basis of this very website.

For illustrative purposes, I have made a minimal repo. It is available [here](https://github.com/Sandbagger/phlex-markdown-sitepress).
